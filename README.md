# Intermediate Software Design in Python
This repository serves as the location for a number of projects I've worked on in a course in Python object-oriented programming. These projects demonstrate my familarity with the following coding topics: Python sequences, user-defined classes and interfaces, modules, packages, collection classes, threads, lambda expressions, list comprehensions, regular expressions and multi-dimensional arrays. Concept topics include OOP project design, recursion, inheritance, polymorphism, functional programming, linked-lists, FIFOs, LIFOs, event-driven parsing, exceptions and guarded code.
